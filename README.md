# Deepfake-Audio-Detection
This project focuses on detecting DeepFake (synthetically generated) audio using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Real and fake audio files are first preprocessed into Mel-spectrogramsâ€”visual representations of the audio frequencies. These spectrograms serve as input to a CNN model trained to classify them as real or fake.
